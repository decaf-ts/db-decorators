### DB-Decorators: Database Operations Made Simple

The db-decorators library provides a comprehensive set of TypeScript decorators and utilities for database operations. It implements the repository pattern with support for model definition, validation, identity management, and operation hooks. The library enables developers to define database models with decorators, perform CRUD operations with validation, and customize behavior during database operations through operation hooks.
