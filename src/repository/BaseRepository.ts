 * @description Base repository implementation providing CRUD operations for models.
 * @summary The BaseRepository class serves as a foundation for repository implementations, providing
 * abstract and concrete methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting model instances.
 * It handles operation lifecycles including prefix and suffix operations, and enforces decorators.
 * @template M - The model type extending Model
 * @template F - The repository flags type, defaults to RepositoryFlags
 * @template C - The context type, defaults to Context<F>
 * @param {Constructor<M>} clazz - The constructor for the model class
 * @class BaseRepository
 * @example
 * class UserModel extends Model {
 *   @id()
 *   id: string;
 *
 *   @required()
 *   name: string;
 * }
 *
 * class UserRepository extends BaseRepository<UserModel> {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super(UserModel);
 *   }
 *
 *   async create(model: UserModel): Promise<UserModel> {
 *     // Implementation

 *   }
 *
 *   async read(key: string): Promise<UserModel> {
 *     // Implementation
 *     return new UserModel({ id: key, name: 'User' });
 *   }
 *
 *   async update(model: UserModel): Promise<UserModel> {
